Each fundamental solution acts as a starting point for generating other solutions through rotations and reflections.
The solutions have rotational symmetry of 4 ....this means that the arrangement of the queens on the chess board looks the same after being rotated by 90,180,270
This can be solved using Brute Force which is exhaustively searching through the possibilities to place the queens on the chess board so that they adhere to the constraints of the
problem.
Backtracking is another method to solve this problem
There are over 4 bn possible combinations that can be placed on the board but only 92 possible solutions to this problem


 by applying a simple rule that chooses one queen from each column,We can bring down the permutations to 16 mn
 Backtracking is a type of recursion because we try to find the solution to the same problem at each state
 Backtracking at every step eliminates those possibilities that cannot be used to solve the problem and then proceeds to those that have to possibility to solve the
 problem at some point in the future.
 The backtracking method can be thought of as a tree that has many different possibilities that branch out of each state

There are mainly 2 factors to solving this problem
    1).Propagation:At each new state the solver looks at the next possible state and thus eliminating all of the other unwanted conditions
    2).Backtracking:The solver backtracks to a previous state given that the current state has no possibility to lead to the end state.
    This method is known as constraint Programming
it is very important in animation that ...when we want to remove something from a certain...we have to redraw over that particular surface
for generating the profile file we do.... kernprof -l your_script.py
to view the file we do ....python -m line_profiler your_script.py.lprof
The backtracking approach was a type of DFS This uses a stack BFS uses a queue

Hill climbing....
        The function starts by making small changes to the initial configuration
        This belongs to the family of local search algorithms
        THe algorithm continues to make these changes until local maxima is obtained which means that no further optimization can be made with the current set of
        moves
        This is very subjective to the initial solution and the final solution depends on the initial solution so if we have a bad initial solution the final
        solution may be not optimal
The  heuristic hill climbing algorithm is a type of informed search algorithm
        There is a heuristic function that estimates how close a state is to the goal state


        The heuristic  searches include....DFS BFS UCS
